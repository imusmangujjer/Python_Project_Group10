# Python_Project_Group10
This project aims to extract data from ESPNcricinfo's website utilizing Pandas for web scraping. The gathered data will be integrated into an SQLite database via the SQLite3 package. The resulting table will be visualized and categorized into two main sections: Batting Records and Bowling Records.

Batting Records: Includes statistics related to player performances while batting, such as runs scored, strike rates, centuries, and other relevant metrics.

Bowling Records: Encompasses statistics linked to bowlers' performances, including wickets taken, economy rates, bowling averages, and other pertinent data.

Utilizing Python's Pandas for web scraping, SQLite3 for database integration, and visualization tools to categorize, display the data by creating a website using HTML, CSS and FLASK. This project will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cricketing data, specifically focusing on batting and bowling records.
